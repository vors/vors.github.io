### [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell)

PowerShell is a cross-platform automation and configuration tool.
I'm a PowerShell [maintainer](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/maintainers/README.md#current-repository-maintainers) with the focus on language, compiler, and engine.

### [PlatyPS](https://github.com/PowerShell/platyPS)

PlatyPS powers both [official Microsoft PowerShell help](https://msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/reference/5.1/microsoft.powershell.core/microsoft.powershell.core) as well as [community projects](https://github.com/lzybkr/PSReadLine/tree/master/docs).
It provides a way to Write PowerShell External Help in Markdown.
More details in PowerShell Team [blog announcement](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/2016/02/05/platyps-write-external-help-files-in-markdown/).

I created platyPS as a hackathon project with my team mates.
