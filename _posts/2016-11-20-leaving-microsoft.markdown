November 18th, 2016 was my last day at Microsoft.

Looking back
------------

I've been hired out of college 4 years ago.
My first project was ERP system [Dynamics AX](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/ax-overview).
Joining Microsoft I had very little Windows experience and was desperately missing `bash`.
Working in Dynamics, I experimented with different options, like `cmd`, `cygwin` and `powershell`.

I didn't quite like few things in PowerShell, but despite that it seems very fresh and powerful.
I asked the team to give me access to PowerShell source code.
They could not because Microsoft and Windows source code permissions.
So I figure out the only way to get my hands on the codebase and try to fix the problems is to join the team.


PowerShell
----------

That's how I joined PowerShell team 2.5 years ago in 2014. 

It was such a fun gig!
I was fortunate to work with smart, friendly and passionate people.
I learn a ton about technologies and the software development.

PowerShell has awesome **community**.
I get to know people who are making their living using the software I write.
People who just enjoy using it.
People whose life is better because PowerShell exists.
That's very inspiring and motivating for me.
Thank you, community!

During the past year, I was mostly focused on 

- language, compiler, and engine
- open-source and [PowerShell GitHub organization](https://github.com/PowerShell)
- documentation and help

Today we have [open-source cross-platform PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell).
Thank you, all the people who made this possible!
And special thanks to [Andy](https://twitter.com/andschwa/): the single person who is mostly responsible for the success of this project.
Andy, it was a pleasure to work with you.

We also have [open-source PowerShell help for core modules](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-Docs/tree/staging/reference/5.1), powered by [platyPS](https://github.com/PowerShell/platyPS).

It was a really great time and it ends on the high note.

Going forward
-------------

I will start working at Dropbox (Seattle) in January 2017.

I'm currently one of PowerShell [maintainers](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/tree/bfd6d654588da09dcb35850e8ea0609b05a2b5ed/docs/maintainers#current-repository-maintainers).
I will continue to be **maintainer**, as far as the team thinks I provide value as a maintainer and I have time for that.
That would make me first non-Microsoft-employee-PowerShell-maintainer.
I think it's a very healthy sign and shows that team treats its open-source projects with transparency and inclusiveness.
I'm looking forward to seeing more non-Microsoft people becoming maintainers.
