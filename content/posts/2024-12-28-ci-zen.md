I been doing build and ci (continuous integration) related work for the last 4 years out of my ~12 years in the industry in US. I was doing it at 2 different companies that shared some similarities and had some strike contrast about the culture and esthetics of the software development practices.
My focus been mostly around python and ML and how to make reasonable workflows for researchers to balance the speed of iteration with general software engineering best practices. 

This winter break I spent some time thinking about the principles that in my opinion help to build systems with nice properties in this domain.

This list is very much inspired by [pep 20: the zen of python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/) as you can guess from the title of the post.


```
simple is better then complex
versatile is better then specific
pragmatic is better then versatile
infrastructure should be boring
stable abstractions are valuable
people being able to unblock themselves is important but hard to capture in metrics
python is ok
ugly code that we shipped last week is better then perfect code we will ship next month
one team's velocity should not be penalized because of another team's code without consent
```
