PowerShell works smooth with .NET from day one. 
But calling .NET APIs was pretty [verbose](http://serverfault.com/questions/74744/using-namespaces-in-powershell) exercise.

To illustrate my point, let's try to call some .NET reflection API.

## Alternate string via reflection

`System.String` is generally immutable in .NET:
when you call `'abc'.Substring(1)` it creates a new object to represent `'bc'` and so on.
You can modify strings with reflection.

Strings are immutable for a very good reason and you don't usually want to do that.
I peek this example just to show the technique.

This code creates `System.String` object and change it's length to access some random bytes from the heap.

**Note:** be careful, it can crash PowerShell process.

~~~powershell
$s = 'abc'
$handle = [string].GetField('m_stringLength', [System.Reflection.BindingFlags]::NonPublic -bor ` 
                                              [System.Reflection.BindingFlags]::Instance)
$handle.SetValue($s, 20)
$s
# Output:
# abc       櫠奙翹 洘 
~~~

This repeating `System.Reflection.BindingFlags` forced me break line for readability.

## Write it shorter with 'using namespace'

PowerShell v5 introduce `using namespace` construct that you can add to the beginning of a script.
It allows you reference .NET types by the short name (exactly the same as C# `using`).

~~~powershell
using namespace System.Reflection
$s = 'abc'
$handle = [string].GetField('m_stringLength', [BindingFlags]::NonPublic -bor [BindingFlags]::Instance)
$handle.SetValue($s, 20)
# Output:
# abc       櫠奙翹 洘 
~~~

That's how you can save a lot of text, working with .NET APIs.

## Poke module

When I talk about reflection and PowerShell, I cannot avoid mentioning [poke](https://github.com/oising/poke) module by [@oising](https://github.com/oising).
It's pure awesome: you can call and **explore** private members as easy as public ones.
Here is how I would rewrite the same code with **poke**

~~~powershell
Import-Module poke
$s = 'abc'
$pokedS = $s | peek
$pokedS.m_stringLength = 20
$s
# Output:
# abc       櫠奙翹 洘
