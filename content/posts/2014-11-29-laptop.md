I like spreadsheets. 
Sometimes I find an old spreadsheet and wonder what the heck I mean, when I created it.
Today I found an one-year old sheet about laptops and want to share it.

I described **scenarios** that my **lightweight** laptop (they used to be called ultrabooks) should satisfy.
I added some scores (10 is maximum) for two laptops that I used for the past year: **macbook air 2012** and **dell xps 12**.

**Note:** I use a laptop as my main working machine at home, I don't have a working station there.

That's pretty much sums up why I prefer macbook air. Yep.
